My name is Caden Juang, and I love thinking about how algorithms can be used to improve our systems of governance.

These days, I work on deep learning methods for civil engineering. I’m trying to find patterns in urban environments that translate to definable characteristics. It’s kind of like chemistry, where certain connections between molecules translate to meaningful chemical properties. Instead, molecules are locations and bonds are relations – traffic, geography, infrastructure, etc.

The intersection of the two fields is a pretty fascinating balance between human expression and modern machine learning. Models draw insights from a deeply imperfect world, so urban planners are crucial interpreters of their results. We cannot, for instance, build a highway through a neighborhood because a model suggests so. It’s our responsibility to navigate historical inequities while engineering solutions for the future. Through my work, I hope to bridge systemic gaps in data and provide equitable methods for future scientists in the discipline.

Aside from research, I care deeply about teaching. At home, I ran a non-profit that trained small business owners to manage online marketplaces. I also co-founded a 20k tutoring-for-donation service and teach AI at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

Among my various threads of interest, I believe misaligned AI to be the biggest threat to humanity in the next century. As such, I spend a lot of time reading and researching current literature on alignment, specifically mechanistic interpretability. I help out at the amazing Bau Lab building tutorials and tooling for their work.
