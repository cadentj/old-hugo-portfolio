summary: "A cool program I work at"
---

On the weekends, I teach [a course in deep learning](https://rsokl.github.io/CogWeb/index.html) at [MIT Lincoln Labs](https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/bwsi). I attended the program as a student two years ago, and I left with a direction that I want to pursue for the rest of my life. Iâ€™m incredibly grateful to have found that meaning.
