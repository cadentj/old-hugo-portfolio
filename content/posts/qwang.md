summary: Some research I did in civil engineering.
---

I recently left a research position in [deep learning methods for civil engineering](https://sites.google.com/view/uirlab/home). My work sought to identify patterns in urban environments that could be translated into definable characteristics.

It was kind of like chemistry üßë‚Äçüî¨:

> Molecular Bonds ‚öõÔ∏è -> Chemical Properties üí°.

But instead,

> Geospatial Connections üó∫Ô∏è (traffic, infrastructure) -> Meaningful Characteristics üå°Ô∏è

However, I realized that there simply wasn't enough data for what I wanted to do. Sure, I could spend my time building methods to infer granularity from large systems. But I just wasn‚Äôt interested enough to do this.

Leaving the lab was an important lesson for me. I often overcommit to multiple projects, stretching myself thin on time. As a result, the quality of each project suffers. Even if I were to cut other projects and focus on civil engineering, I just wasn't curious enough. So I ended up leaving the lab.
