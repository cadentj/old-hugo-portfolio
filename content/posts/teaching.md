Outside of work and research, I care deeply about teaching. 

## Beaverworks

On the weekends, I teach course in deep learning at MIT Lincoln Labs.

## Brick 2 Byte

At home, I ran a service that built online platforms for under resourced small businesses affected by the pandemic.

In the summer of '21, 
I guided a cohort of 5 business owners through weekly sessions on building simple websites in Bootstrap and streamlining management in Excel. I recieved $2,000 from the Chapman fellowship for community service to subsidize web building costs for business owners. In the month following the service, owners saw an average of increase of 16% in both foot traffic and revenue.



## Community Tutoring

During the pandemic, I co-founded a local tutoring-for-donation service. We raised over $20,000 for the local food bank and kept kids educated during the pandemic.
