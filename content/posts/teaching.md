Outside of work and research, I care deeply about teaching. 

## Beaverworks

On the weekends, I teach [a course in deep learning](https://rsokl.github.io/CogWeb/index.html) at [MIT Lincoln Labs](https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/bwsi). 

I attended the camp as a student two years ago, and I'm infinitely greatful for Ryan and all the wonderful TA's that year - Jacob, Dharshini, and Laya to name a few. Everything I learned at the camp -- gradient descent, neural networks, transformers -- I continue to apply every day. 

These days, I help run programs for under represented STEM students. I'm also designing curriculum modules on [AI Safety](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/) with an emphasis on interpretability.

At home, I ran [a service](https://bricktobytedemo.wordpress.com/) that built online platforms for under resourced small businesses affected by the pandemic. 

In the summer of 2021, I guided a cohort of 5 business owners through weekly lessons on simple web development and management. I recieved a [$2,000 community service grant](https://sjs.myschoolapp.com/page/fellowships?siteId=1228&ssl=1) to subsidize web building costs for business owners. In the month following the service, owners saw an average of increase of 16% in both foot traffic and revenue.

## Community Tutoring

During the pandemic, I co-founded a tutoring-for-donation service. A couple friends and I were fortunate enough to attend a small school with pseudo-functioning online classes. But for the majority of students in my area, the quality of education dropped off sharply. 

Through summer courses and short, one-on-one tutoring sessions, we raised over $20,000 for the local food bank.
